 you want to create multiple user accounts on a remote server using Ansible. You can use a loop to iterate over a list of user names and create the accounts.
---
- name: User Account Playbook
  hosts: webserver
  become: yes

  vars:
    users_to_create:
      - alice
      - bob
      - charlie

  tasks:
    - name: Create User Accounts
      user:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: present
      with_items: "{{ users_to_create }}"
